    <p>
        An NBA game runs 48 minutes (Four 12 minute quarters). Players do not typically play the <br>
        full game, subbing in and out as necessary. Your job is to extrapolate a player's points <br>
        per game if they played the full 48 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        Write a function that takes two arguments, ppg (points per game) and mpg (minutes per <br>
        game) and returns a straight extrapolation of ppg per 48 minutes rounded to the nearest <br>
        tenth. Return 0 if 0.<br>
        <br>
        Examples:<br>
        <br>
        pointsPer48(12, 20) // 28.8<br>
        pointsPer48(10, 10) // 48 <br>
        pointsPer48(5, 17) // 14.1 <br>
        pointsPer48(0, 0) // 0<br>
